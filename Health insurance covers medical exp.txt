Health insurance covers medical expenses such as doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, and prescription drugs. Common terms include deductible (amount paid before insurance starts), co-payment (fixed amount per service), and premium (monthly cost of the plan). Policies can be individual or employer-sponsored.
